    :intro: Data samples broken down by the reporting interval.
    :params:
    - :name: duration
      :desc: 'the length of time (in seconds) to return data for. Default: 4 hours.'
      :mandatory: optional
    - :name: epoint
      :desc: 'the end point in time (in unix time) to return metrics for. e.g. epoint - duration = start time. Default: the time the request is made.'
      :mandatory: optional
    :attributes:
    - :name: :interval
      :desc: The reporting interval in seconds. e.g. A value of 600 means the statistics are generated every 10 minutes.
    - :name: :metrics
      :desc: A hash containing the timestamp and response time metrics broken down into component values (in milliseconds). See Overview for more details.
    :outro: 'A note about the timestamp values: min and max correspond to start time and end time, respectively. The values in the list plus the min value gives you the appropriate timestamp (in seconds).'
