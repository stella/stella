    <br/>
    <h4 class="cufon">Billing Period</h4>

    <p>Paid plans are billed on monthly, on the same day you subscribed.</p>


    <h4 class="cufon">Changing plans</h4>

    <p>You're welcome to switch plans at any time, unless your account would exceed a less expensive plan's limitations.</p>

    <p>If you've already been billed for the current month, you won't be charged/receive the difference. If you haven't been charged for the month, you'll be charged the new plan amount.</p>


    <h4 class="cufon">How do I cancel my account?</h4>

    <p>You can cancel your account at any time by logging into your account, clicking the "Account" link in the user box at the top right, then clicking the "Cancel your account" link at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <p>Once you cancel you won't be charged again, but you are responsible for whatever charges have already been incurred for the current billing period. If you've already been billed for the current month, you will not receive a refund. If you haven't been charged for the month, you will not be charged.</p>
