    <h3 class="cufon">Our Terms of Use</h3>

    <p><em>Updated June 4, 2010</em></p>

    <p>Welcome to BlameStella! We hope that you will enjoy our state-of-the art website performance testing services (the "Services"). These terms of use (the "Terms of Use") are a legal agreement between you and The Blamey &amp; Stella Information Co., a Montreal-based company ("<strong>BLAMESTELLA</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>" or "<strong>our</strong>") setting forth, among other things, the terms and conditions for your access and use of the <a href="http://www.blamestella.com/" title="Stella loves websites!">www.blamestella.com</a> website, and any related sub-domains, operated by BLAMESTELLA (the "<strong>Website</strong>" or "<strong>BlameStella</strong>").</p>
  
    <h4>PLEASE READ ALL THE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY</h4>

    <p><em>Use of the Website.</em> By using the Website, you accept and agree to the provisions of the Terms of Use without any reservations, modifications, additions or deletions. If you do not agree to any provisions contained in the Terms of Use, you are not authorized to use the Website.  You may be denied access to the Website, with or without notice to you if you do not comply with any provisions of the Terms of Use.</p>

    <p><em>Amendments.</em>  We may from time to time modify the Terms of Use and will post a copy of the amended Terms of Use on the Website, so we encourage you to review them periodically. If we make any substantial changes to the Terms of Use, we will notify you by sending a notice to the email address specified in your account or by posting a prominent notice on our pages. If you do not agree to, or cannot comply with, the Terms of Use as amended, you are not authorized to use the Website. You will be deemed to have accepted the Terms of Use as amended if you continue to use the Website after any amendments are posted on the Website. We reserve the right to refuse to provide our Services to anyone at any time.</p>


    <h3 class="cufon">1. Resources Used for the Provision of Services</h3>

    <p>To conduct our testing Services, we generate real web traffic between our servers (i.e., virtual users) and the website(s) to be tested. We record statistical data from the generated traffic and create reports based on that data to analyze the performance of the website(s) being tested.</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>For free tests (no registration or free accounts), our servers will generate a number of requests (currently 6) one time only.</li>
    	<li>For subscription-based tests, our servers will automatically generate a number of requests (currently 6) every few minutes (5mn or 10mn depending on the account). In order to run tests automatically at intervals, you will need to include a short authentication code on the site to be tested and nothing else.  We will not use this authentication code for any purposes other than the performance of the Services (e.g., we do not collect any personal or statistical information from the website(s) being tested). You are solely responsible (i) to ensure that these website(s) can accommodate the requests from our servers, as the number of requests from our servers may increase the traffic to the website(s) that are tested and (ii)) to ensure that the authentication code that you may include in such website(s) does not interfere with the rest of the code of this(these) website(s).</li>
    </ul>


    <h3 class="cufon">2. Types of Account</h3>

    <p>Different Services will be made available to you depending on (i) whether you access and use the Website anonymously or with a registered account and (ii) the type of accounts you subscribe to:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>Anonymous Use - No Registration: If you decide not to register, your access to and use of the Website will be anonymous and the use of the Services will be limited to the following:</li>
    	<ul>
      	<li class="next">Running free tests. We restrict the number of tests for any given website and from a any given user. The results of all free tests will be made publicly available on the Website.</li>
      	<li class="next">Viewing of the history of test results (results for tests requested by all anonymous users only).</li>
      </ul>
  
    	<li>Registration: If you decide to open an account (free or paid account), you agree (i) to provide truthful and accurate account information, including but not limited to a username, password, name, valid email address, payment information (collectively, your "Account Information") and (ii) to update your Account Information as necessary to keep it accurate. BLAMESTELLA does not store passwords, only one-way derivative of passwords (i.e., hashes). <br/><br/>
	
        Registered users have access to the following Services, depending on whether they open a free or paid account:
      <ul>
    	<li class="next">Free Accounts: Same Services as those provided to non-registered users, but we will maintain your Account Information and the history of all the tests you run. Free accounts have one authorized website (like paid accounts), but without the automated monitoring. Authorization for free accounts allows the user to run more tests against the site that the user confirms authorization for. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE RESULTS OF ALL TESTS that are performed with a free account will be made publicly available on the Website. </li>

    	<li class="next">Paid Accounts: Same Services as those provided to free accounts, but you will be able to create and run private tests (accessible only by you) and monitor the performance for those websites that you confirm authorization for. </li>
      </ul>

    <br/>
    Confirmation is based on an authentication code that is unique to your account and to the site being authenticated. By confirming that you have authorization to monitor the performance of a website, you represent that you HAVE sufficient rights to run the testS on such website, including THE RIGHT TO INCLUDE OUR SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION CODE.</li>
    </ul>
